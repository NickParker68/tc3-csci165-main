I uploaded as much as I could with this lab. I felt confident debugging the programs until the last two. I was 
working steady on the lab for the last week with little trouble. unfortunately as I was finishing up my temperature 
program I realized that I must've made a mistake. I think it was the way I handled the variable in the getters and setters.
I also am still having trouble with 2d arrays so I coudln't manage the election program. I will try to work faster
on th labs and be more consious of testing my programs early.
